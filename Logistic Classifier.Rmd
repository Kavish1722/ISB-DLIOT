## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
setwd('/Users/kavish/desktop/DLIOT')
test <- read.csv("iris_test.csv")
training <- read.csv("iris_training.csv")
#Logistic Regression
Logit <- multinom(virginica ~.,data= training)
Logit1 <- stepAIC(Logit)
prediction <- predict(Logit1,test)
table(prediction,test$virginica)
```

## Including Plots


```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
